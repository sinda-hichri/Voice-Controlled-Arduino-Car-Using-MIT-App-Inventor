Make sure to use a 12V battery or power supply for your project as a 9V battery won't be sufficient 
Make sure your "Enbale" Jumpers are installed to your H-bridge for your project to work 
You may face Bluetooth Connectivity issues, I have managed to solve MIT's 503 error code concerning bluetooth connection but I couldn't find a solution to the 507 error code.
If u face a 507 bluetooth error code, turn your bluetooth on and off and restart your AI companion on MIT app inventor 
Note that I used a HC-05 Bluetooth module for my project, with a baudrate of 9600, configured using Arduino's "AT" commands
